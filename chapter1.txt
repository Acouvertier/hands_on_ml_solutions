1. How would you define machine learning: 
The process by which a machine creates the routines to solve a task without 
direct coding of the algorithm. 

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines: 
Problems with no known algorithms
Problems with extremely large data sets
Problems where the code needs to by dynamics sudden changes in information
Problems where trends or solutions change drastically

3. What is a labeled training set:
A labeled training set is a data set that includes the features to be studied
(i.e, the data collected) as well as the expected output that thw ML algo should 
produces. These expected outputs are usually applied by hand.

4. What are the two most common supervised task: 
Image recognition and linear regression 

5. Can you name for common unsupervised tasks: 
clustering, anomaly, dimension reduction, rule learning. 

6. What type of Machine Learn algo would you use to allow a robot to walk 
in various unknown terrains?
unsupervised, reinfoircement learning (online)

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups? 
clustering

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as supervised or unsupervised?
Initially this would be supervised as people had to mark spam messages. As the algorithm gets better 
it can be adapted to unsupervised/semi-supervised where new labels are input as needed.

9. What is an online learning system? 
Online learning is when a ML algo is able to actively adapt to data that is 
produced in production enviornment

10. What is out of core learning?
When an online learning algorithm is trained offline on a large data set that cannot fit on one machine's memory
(seems independet of the type of algorithm, more focused on size of data and training location)
